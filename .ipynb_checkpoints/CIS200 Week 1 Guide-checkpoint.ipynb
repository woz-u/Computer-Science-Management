    "CIS200 is your starting point in understanding what computer science actually is—not just using technology, but learning how problems are solved through logic, structure, and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will begin learning how computer scientists think. That means learning how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Break down a problem into smaller steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe those steps clearly (this is called designing an algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represent information in a structured way\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turn your ideas into executable instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not expected to already know programming or computing theory. What matters is learning the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🔍 What this course builds toward\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the course, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design step-by-step procedures to solve problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use basic procedural programming techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how searching and sorting processes work\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose appropriate data types for a given task\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work confidently with your operating system to save, run, and manage files\n",

    "---\n",
    "### 🧠 Why this actually matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Every computing-related field—from networking, databases, cybersecurity, AI, and software engineering—ultimately depends on:\n",

    "* Good problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithmic thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "* Representing data properly\n",

    "---\n",
    "### 💬 What you should expect\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To learn concepts first, then see them applied\n",
    "\n",
    "* To think before you write\n",
    "\n",
    "* To revise your approach as you learn better methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* To get better over time through repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not expected to be perfect in Week 1.\n",
    "You are expected to follow directions, try, ask questions correctly, and work consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your starting point. If you stay engaged, apply what you learn, and follow the structure provided, CIS200 will not just be a requirement—it will be the gateway into thinking and working like someone who solves problems using technology.\n",

    "- Getting oriented with how learning works here  \n",
    "- Understanding basic structures of computing  \n",
    "- Completing smaller introductory tasks  \n",
    "\n",
    "Week 2 increases responsibility by expecting you to:\n",
    "- Work more independently  \n",
    "- Understand sequence, logic, procedural structure  \n",
    "- Apply material rather than just react to it  \n",
    "\n",
    "Week 3 expects:\n",
    "- Full ownership of time management  \n",
    "- Ability to complete higher-level tasks with less guidance  \n",
    "- Understanding of how earlier concepts feed into later ones  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏳ Why Time Management Matters in This Course\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an upper-level course within a **full 2-year degree that is compressed into 11 months**.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means:\n",
    "- What is normally spread out over much longer academic terms must be absorbed and completed quickly  \n",
    "- Your effort level is closer to maintaining a **part-time workload—if not full-time**  \n",
    "- Weekly deadlines matter  \n",

    "### 🌟 Important Mindset to Keep\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always return to the material later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective during these three weeks is:\n",
    "✔ To reach at least a 70% passing threshold  \n",
    "✔ To complete all required lessons  \n",
    "✔ To maintain momentum  \n",
    "\n",
    "After passing, you can revisit lessons and reinforce topics at your own pace.\n",

    "Successful students consistently:\n",
    "- Work early  \n",
    "- Don’t wait until the deadline day  \n",
    "- Ask questions early  \n",
    "- Treat the course like a real commitment  \n",

    "## 3. How to Stay Ahead (and Not Fall Behind)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the hardest parts about this course is that each Exeter LMS Lesson contains multiple Cengage/MindTap units—not just one. Because of that, it’s not enough to simply “finish the assignment that is due.” You need to stay slightly ahead so that the next lesson never begins at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing only exactly what is due, a better plan is to **finish one full Cengage unit each day, and also begin the next one**, even if you only complete a small portion of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what that looks like in practice during Week 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day | Recommended Progress |\n",
    "|------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Monday (course opens) | Complete Unit 1 + begin a few pages of Unit 2 |\n",

    "### 💡 Why this works\n",

    "You simply finish Unit 2 and move into Unit 3.\n",

    "- Treat deadlines as starting points rather than finish lines  \n",
    "- Wait until Wednesday and Sunday evenings  \n",

    "- Experience lower stress  \n",

    "It rewards **steady, daily forward movement**.\n",

    "Always complete your work in a local tool **before** you upload to the LMS.\n",

    "Working directly inside a browser window or LMS can lead to:\n",

    "- files not properly saving  \n",

    "- back up your work  \n",
    "- review before submitting  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "When seeking help, always include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- assignment name  \n",
    "- Cengage unit  \n",
    "- question number  \n",

    "> \"I'm on Cengage Unit 4, Question 7 — my output is different. Screenshot included.\"\n",

    "- **Wednesday**\n",
    "- **Sunday**\n",
    "\n",

    "This course is **open-resource friendly**:\n",
    "- You may use AI\n",
    "- You may search online\n",

    "Your priority in this course is simple:\n",
    "### 🎯 Reach at least a 70% passing score.\n",

    "- revisit lessons after passing  \n",
